# JIV - Jonathan's Item Viewer

A complete, fully functional item, recipe, and usage viewer. Complete with batteries included, there's no need for ay extensions (but you can still develop them!)

## Isn't this JEI/REI/EMI?

Well, not really. See, in my quest to create a standardized starting point for my modpacks, I found myself often extending JEI/REI for my complex, additional recipes. The code I used was simply a bit out of reach for JEI/REI to know whatr I'm working on, and thus the recipe comes out being totally wrong.

    If you want to learn more about my modpack lib, and use it for yourself, read more about it [here]().

I decided to create an additional item viewer, and I ensured it was fully compatible with any mod items and recipes I would want to make. Then I thought: "why stop there?". I already have the base down for an item viewer, I could definately make it a fully functional public usage mod. Thus, this mod came about, and it is complete with:

- Item viewage, you can see it's recipe, and what it's used for.
- Highly complex item "getter", can retrieve the most complex of recipes.
- Standardized API, anyone can easily make an extension if you fel the batteries included arn't enough.

- Can I fork this mod to version XX, and loader XX. Yes, go ahead. Don't even bother asking. Just be sure to include a link to my orriginal project in your description/README/whatever.
